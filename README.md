Currently working on this lightweight & portable Python(V.Python3) program, primarily for Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS. This would help you or Network Admin to test Wi-Fi Network against anonymous Deauthentication attack(A kind of DOS attack on Wi-Fi Access Points using BSSID/MAC and Channel of Router/Access Point)

=============================================================================
Some Helpful Terminology to Understand the Process:

The BSSID (also called a mac (media access control) address) is an address which specifies the router’s network card. 
The MAC address is made up of 2 parts, xx:xx:xx:yy:yy:yy (C4:E9:84:3F:26:04)

The first part is xx:xx:xx. i.e: C4:E9:84 These groupings specify the maker of the network card.

The last three groupings: yy:yy:yy. i,.e: 3F:26:04. These groupings specify the exact network card. Not the make or model but the exact network card, much like a license plate specifies the exact car.

Each manufacture has a set of MAC addresses they’re allowed to use. These are the xx:xx:xx groupings. Within these MAC addresses are the exact cards. You need both parts to find out the exact network card, but you only need the first grouping to find out the manufacturer. Most of the open or even secured Wi-Fi access point/Routers broadcast it’s and connected devices MAC(BSSID). In short whole network is exposed, basically.
